<p class="binderItem"><strong>Question 5</strong><br/>Does the federal science funding community (e.g. the granting councils, the CFI agencies or organizations that distribute funds supporting investigator-led research) consult the research community to ensure that their programs are aligned to the changing needs of researchers? If so, how? If not, should it and how should it?</p>
