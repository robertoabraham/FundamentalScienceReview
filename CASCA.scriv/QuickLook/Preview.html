<p class="binderItem"><strong>Abstract</strong><br/>The central message:<br/>
<br/>
1. NSERC Discovery Grants are too low. However, the Discovery Grant model is an excellent fit for Astronomy and Astrophysics. It fosters innovation through programs rather than projects.<br/>
<br/>
2. Funding for Space Astronomy via the Canadian Space Agency is too low.<br/>
<br/>
3. We should aspire to be at the top run of world astrophysics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Question 1</strong><br/>Is the federal funding ecosystem meeting the needs of the Canadian research community? As the needs change, is the ecosystem able to adapt and accommodate?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Question 5</strong><br/>Does the federal science funding community (e.g. the granting councils, the CFI agencies or organizations that distribute funds supporting investigator-led research) consult the research community to ensure that their programs are aligned to the changing needs of researchers? If so, how? If not, should it and how should it?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Question 8</strong><br/>Comment on career supporting funding versus project-based funding. What are the pros and cons of each structure? Should support structures be higher at the front end of careers and less so as they are established? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Question 12</strong><br/>Do current federal programs encourage and support domestic collaboration?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Question 13</strong><br/>To what extent do you collaborate internationally and how important is this to your work? Is there sufficient flexibility in granting council or other funding programs for participation in international collaborations? Are there particular research areas where more emphasis on international collaboration is needed?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Question 15</strong><br/>Is current support for major science initiatives or “Big Science” including large international collaborations and facilities effectively meeting the needs of researchers? If not, how can this be improved?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Question 17</strong><br/>17. Identify the unique barriers that the following groups face in obtaining support for investigator-led research. Do current programs address these barriers? What else could be done to address these barriers?<br/>
a) students, trainees, and early career researchers<br/>
b) women<br/>
c) aboriginals and other underrepresented groups</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Question 19</strong><br/>What should the vision be for Canadian science? If we imagine an even more successful future for Canadian science, what does success look like and how should it be measured?</p>
</li>
